<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
## Concept Process

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->

* For this project my entire application was based off of Swift & SwiftUI through XCode. I made use of iOS’s components in regards of my application’s look and feel and designed everything on Figma. Furthermore I tested the user flow as well as design principles’ effectivity through Figma’s prototyping tools.

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
The most important learning with this module was programming an application for iOS and learning the iOS ecosystem for the first time. <br> I also learned a lot from using Swift and SwiftUI in XCode which are all languages/interfaces new to me. <br> I have become a lot more comfortable with the overall idea of development for mobile in general and have learned a lot from both iOS and MacOS as operating systems.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
By far the toughest challenge this term was not the project but rather compatibility for working on the project itself. Finding a compatible device to use XCode cost me a lot of time but I’m happy I did manage to catch up quite well.
<br>
Working out time management with being behind after 4 weeks was quite a challenge in terms of keeping up with other projects and learning a new language for development.
<br>
Lastly figuring out how different Swift is from other languages while appreciating its neat functionality was also a challenge.

### Reviews & Testing
<!-- stipulate how you've conducted testing in the form of peer reviews, feedback and also functionality testing, like unit tests (if applicable) -->

#### Feedback from Reviews

`Peer Reviews` were conducted by my fellow students and lecturer. The following feedback I found useful:

* Making the images bigger.
* Having consistency between elements.

#### Unit Tests

`Unit Tests` were conducted to establish working functionality. Here are all the tests that were ran:

* Good navigation, need to work more on productivity!
* Got a lot more done in terms of functionality!

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* Better recipe display system.
* Have more fixed components and small tweaks.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
